# SPAM.IXI
This is a simple IOTA Ict IXI built to send a random transaction once every 10 seconds. The purpose of this module is not to stress the network, but just to simulate some fake activity on idle nodes.

## Installation

This guide assumes you have an Ict up and running. Please find instructions on [iotaledger/ict](https://github.com/iotaledger/ict#installation).

1. Under the web gui of your Ict node, go to your "manage modules" tab
2. Click "install third party module" button
3. Type in `locknic/spam.ixi`
4. Click install

To stop spamming, simply remove the module 

Note: You can also build this module yourself as with any other
